<!-- Objective:
A simple task management system API using NestJS and TypeORM (with MySQL).

Task entity should have auto-incrementing id, title, description, status (enum: done, in progress, pending), createdAt and updatedAt (both autogenerated timestamps).

Create a controller with following CRUD operations:
1) Create new task(with dto)
2) Get all tasks
3) Get a single task by id,
4) Update task by id (use createquery)
5) Delete task by id (soft delete task)

Use appropriate NestJS and TypeORM decorators for defining routes, controllers, services and entity relations(if any)

Logging:
Log incoming requests to the console.

Using Express.js for routing // Main.js
